Stamp Challenge - Dan DiMartino
This is Dan's Thesis Stamp Challenge.
The goal is to recreate an HTML page that was provided as PDF, PNG, .sketch files.

I plan to spend around 15-20 minutes on boxing and around 15-20 minutes on site planning before drawing it out.

Below is the full challenge:

Please read the entire document before starting

Goal: Create an HTML web page that looks as close as possible to the attached design.

Please do not use fronend/backend frameworks/libraries (jQuery, bootstrap, fontawesome, react, angular, react ...).

The links don't need to point anywhere ("#" works fine), the form doesn't need to lead anywhere but it needs to be styled, the menu(s) should be implemented but it's up to you how.

If you believe the design has flaws or can be improved, feel free to make the changes and provide your reasoning along with your coe submission (inside your README file).

You should pay attention to (because we will, too):
* Responsive design (check how it looks on mobile devices/smaller screens/larger screens)
* Page load time
* Varioius element states (hover, focus, ...)

You should NOT worry about:
*Getting the exact front face icons, photos, images, or illustrations.
*Content. Feel free to use dummy content (lorem ipsum, ...),
Trying to open the .sketch file

Additional notes:
* If you're not able to open the .sketch file, please use the PDF or PNG file instead.
* If you can't use the attached background image, please feel free to use any other image.
If you're unsure about something, please use your best judgment.

Extra credit:
* If you notice any flaw in the attached design, point it out and explain it.

When you're done, please push it to an online code repository of your choice (GitHub, BitBucket, Gitlab, or similar) and send your interviewer the link. You can make the repository public.

[Github-specific note] If you strongly prefer to keep your repository private, please share access to the repository with "***********" Github user.
